# EveBrainfucker  

This is my Secondlife implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter.

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language which has only 8 instructions, all of which are implemented in this script.

So, no longer you need to fiddle around with that idiotic Secondlife scripting language, just write your stuff with Brainfuck! ✌ 

You can read more about Brainfuck on its wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

## Usage

Place your program inside the `program` variable and save the script in a prim. It will run the program on load and touch, so you may want to change that.

## Runaway scripts 

This script will abort the execution after a certain amount of instructions to prevent the sim from burning down. You can adjust this at the end of the `execute` function, look for the check on `instructionRan`.

## Why

I don't know.
